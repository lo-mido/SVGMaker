  ## Description
 The assignment was to create a Node.js command-line application that allows users to generate a simple logo for their projects. The application should prompt the user for input regarding the logo's text, text color, shape, and shape color. After receiving the input, the application should create an SVG file named logo.svg based on the user's selections and save it to the local directory. The application should also print the message "Generated logo.svg" in the command line. The assignment required the creation of a README file with instructions and a link to a walkthrough video demonstrating the application's functionality.
## Motivation
My motivation for undertaking this project was to develop a practical tool that could be useful for freelance web developers and other individuals who need simple logos for their projects. Designing logos often requires graphic design skills, which not everyone possesses. By creating this command-line application, I aimed to provide a convenient and cost-effective solution for generating logos without the need for a dedicated graphic designer.
 ## Problem Solving
This project addresses the problem of creating simple logos without the expertise of a graphic designer. Many freelance developers or small business owners may not have the resources to hire a designer, yet they still require logos for their projects or products. This application streamlines the logo generation process by allowing users to input their desired text, colors, and shapes, resulting in a customized SVG logo that meets their needs.
## Lessons Learned and Purpose
Through this project, I gained experience in working with user input, file manipulation, and generating SVG content programmatically. I learned how to handle user prompts in a command-line environment, process input, and create SVG files using JavaScript. This project also provided insights into the importance of creating user-friendly interfaces even in command-line applications.

I built this project to demonstrate my proficiency in Node.js development and to create a practical utility that could be beneficial to a specific target audience. The application's simplicity and focus on a specific task reflect its purpose of solving a practical problem for users.
